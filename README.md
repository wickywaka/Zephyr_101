# Zephyr_101
Introduction to Zephyr with real life projects

Zephyr is a real time operating system that is focused on IoT. It provides several ready to use libraries and components saving developers time. It uses device trees for hardware abstraction and its own software APIs allows for a more platform independent source code enabling easier change of the underlying hardware without the need to change software.
